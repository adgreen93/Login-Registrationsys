# Login-Registrationsys
A login &amp; registration system made with PHP and mySQL - backbone for a employer/employee site or blog posting system!

To link your database, use connection.php. There is a variable defined in index.php which links to my database, so change it to your name and you'll be good to go.

The goal here is to make a employer/employee login system - employees can enter hours, upload files, etc. Employeer/admin can see everything and approve files and etc. 

Not pretty, but functional.
